# CPS803 Final Project: Music Generation Using Transformers

Our final project for the Ryerson University course CPS803 Machine Learning, in which we apply our understanding of transformers to the problem of music generation. This project was largely based on the Peter Bloem transformer example [[1]](#1), and the dataset pre-processing was informed by the 2018 Music Transformer paper [[2]](#2). Due to time constraints the full innovations of the Music Transformer algorithm could not be implemented.
